# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This implementation allows a human player to play against a computer player that makes random moves.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tictactoe.py` file.
2. You will be prompted to input your moves by specifying the number corresponding to the square you want to mark.
3. The game will display the board after each move, and it will determine the winner or declare a tie when appropriate.
4. Enjoy the game!

## File Structure

- `tictactoe.py`: Contains the main game logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the game.
- `player.py`: Contains classes for human and computer players. (In the provided implementation, the classes are directly included in the main file.)

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the `tictactoe.py` file using a Python interpreter:
