# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple Python program to solve Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `sudoku_solver.py` file using Python.
4. The program will solve the example Sudoku puzzle provided in the code.
5. You can modify the `board` variable in the code to solve your own Sudoku puzzles.

## Algorithm

The program uses a backtracking algorithm to recursively try placing numbers in empty cells until a solution is found. It checks the validity of each placement according to Sudoku rules (no repeated numbers in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids).

## Example

An example Sudoku puzzle is provided in the code. You can modify this puzzle or provide your own Sudoku puzzle to solve.
